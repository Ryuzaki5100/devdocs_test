## Function Documentation

This document details the function `DemoApplication.main` and its dependencies.

### 1. `DemoApplication.main(String[] args)`

**Description:**

This is the main entry point for the Spring Boot application. It initializes and starts the Spring application context.  The function leverages the `SpringApplication` class to bootstrap the application.

**Functionality:**

The function executes `SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);`. This static method from the `SpringApplication` class performs the following actions:

1.  **Creates an `ApplicationContext`:** It creates a suitable `ApplicationContext` instance based on the classpath (e.g., `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` or `AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext`). The type of context created depends on whether it is a web application or not.

2.  **Registers the main application class:** It registers `DemoApplication.class` as a configuration class for the application context. This class will be scanned for Spring components (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, `@Repository`).

3.  **Performs component scanning:**  It scans the packages containing `DemoApplication.class` and any sub-packages for Spring components and automatically registers them as beans in the application context.  This is how Spring discovers and manages your application's components.

4.  **Starts the embedded server (if web application):** If the application is a web application (i.e., it includes Spring Web), it starts an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) to handle HTTP requests. The default port is 8080, but this can be configured.

5.  **Executes `CommandLineRunner` and `ApplicationRunner` beans:** It finds any beans that implement the `CommandLineRunner` or `ApplicationRunner` interfaces and executes their `run()` methods after the application context is fully initialized. This allows you to perform initialization tasks when the application starts.

6.  **Listens for application events:** The Spring application context publishes events during its lifecycle (e.g., `ApplicationStartedEvent`, `ApplicationReadyEvent`). The `SpringApplication` class listens for these events and performs actions accordingly (e.g., logging the startup banner).

7.  **Handles exceptions:**  It handles any exceptions that occur during the startup process and logs them appropriately.

**Parameters:**

*   `args`: An array of strings representing command-line arguments passed to the application. These arguments can be accessed and used to configure the application.

**Return Value:**

This function does not return any value (void).

**Business Logic:**

The business logic is to bootstrap the Spring Boot application which involves:

*   Setting up the application context,
*   Scanning for components,
*   Configuring the server and
*   Executing any initialization logic.

This enables the application to begin serving requests, processing data, or performing whatever tasks it's designed to do. The `DemoApplication` class serves as the central starting point for the application.

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**

The cyclomatic complexity of this function is 1, as it has only one execution path (calling `SpringApplication.run`). The complexity resides within the `SpringApplication.run` method itself, which is a complex operation.

**Pain Points:**

*   **Startup time:** The `SpringApplication.run` method can take a significant amount of time to execute, especially for large applications with many dependencies.
*   **Configuration:**  Configuring the `SpringApplication` can be complex, especially when dealing with custom configurations or multiple environments.
*   **Dependency Management:** Spring Boot relies heavily on dependency injection. Poorly managed dependencies or circular dependencies can cause startup errors or runtime issues.
