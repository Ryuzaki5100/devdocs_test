## Function Documentation

This documentation details the provided function `DemoApplication.main(String[] args)` and its dependencies, outlining their functionalities and execution order.

### 1. `DemoApplication.main(String[] args)`

**Purpose:** This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application. It's responsible for bootstrapping and starting the application context.

**Body:**

```java
SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
```

**Explanation:**

*   `SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args)`: This is the core statement. It's a static method provided by the Spring Boot framework.
    *   `DemoApplication.class`:  Specifies the primary Spring component class. Spring Boot uses this class to bootstrap the application context. Typically, `DemoApplication` would be annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` (or a combination of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`), signaling to Spring Boot that this is the main configuration class.
    *   `args`: This is the command-line arguments array passed to the application. These arguments can be used to configure the application's behavior or pass runtime parameters.

**How it Works:**

1.  Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method performs the following actions:
    *   Creates an `ApplicationContext` (typically a `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` or `AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext` based on the environment).
    *   Registers a `CommandLinePropertySource` to expose command-line arguments as Spring properties.
    *   Configures and starts an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) if the application is a web application.
    *   Performs auto-configuration based on the dependencies on the classpath and the configured properties. This is where Spring Boot automatically configures beans, data sources, message brokers, and other components based on the included dependencies.
    *   Launches the application by invoking the `run()` methods of any `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner` beans that are present in the application context.

**Business Logic:**

The `main` function's business logic is essentially *application bootstrapping*. It doesn't directly perform any specific business task. Instead, it sets up the environment so that other components within the application can perform their business logic. It delegates the task of instantiating and configuring the application context to Spring Boot's `SpringApplication` class.

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**

The cyclomatic complexity of this function is very low (1). It consists of a single statement.

**Pain Points:**

The `main` function itself doesn't usually present pain points. The complexity lies in understanding *what* Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` is doing behind the scenes. Debugging issues related to application startup often requires understanding the auto-configuration process, property sources, and Spring's bean lifecycle. Common issues include:

*   **Configuration conflicts:** Multiple configurations trying to define the same bean.
*   **Missing dependencies:** The application might fail to start if required dependencies are missing from the classpath.
*   **Incorrect property settings:** Incorrect values in `application.properties` or `application.yml` can cause unexpected behavior.
*   **Auto-configuration issues:**  Spring Boot might not be auto-configuring components as expected.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a REST API for a library management system.  The `DemoApplication.main()` would be the entry point. When executed, it would initialize the Spring Boot application, potentially starting an embedded Tomcat server and configuring the necessary beans for handling HTTP requests, connecting to a database, and managing books and users.
