## Function Documentation: Demo Application

This documentation details the functions of a Spring Boot application, starting with the entry point and proceeding through its dependencies.

**1. `DemoApplication.main(String[] args)`**

*   **Purpose:** This is the main entry point for the Spring Boot application. It initializes and starts the Spring application context.
*   **Signature:** `public static void main(String[] args)`
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `args`: An array of strings representing command-line arguments passed to the application.
*   **Body:**

    ```java
    SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    ```

*   **Explanation:**

    This function leverages the `SpringApplication.run()` method to bootstrap and launch the Spring Boot application.

    1.  `SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args)`: This static method performs the following actions:

        *   **Class Loading:** Loads the `DemoApplication` class, which typically contains the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation. This annotation is a convenience annotation that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
        *   **Application Context Creation:** Creates an appropriate `ApplicationContext` based on the classpath and configuration. In a web application, this will often be a `WebApplicationContext`.
        *   **Bean Definition Scanning:** Scans for Spring components (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@RestController`) within the specified package and its subpackages. These components are then registered as beans in the application context.
        *   **Auto-Configuration:** Applies auto-configuration based on the dependencies present on the classpath. Spring Boot attempts to automatically configure beans based on the available libraries. For example, if `spring-webmvc` is on the classpath, it will configure a dispatcher servlet.
        *   **Application Event Broadcasting:** Publishes application events such as `ApplicationStartingEvent`, `ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent`, `ApplicationPreparedEvent`, `ApplicationStartedEvent`, and `ApplicationReadyEvent`. Listeners can respond to these events to perform custom initialization logic.
        *   **Server Startup (if applicable):** Starts an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) if the application is a web application.
        *   **Return Value:** Returns an `ApplicationContext` instance, representing the running Spring application.

*   **Business Logic:**

    The business logic of this function is to start the entire Spring Boot application. It doesn't directly implement any specific application logic but sets up the foundation for the application to function.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:**

    The cyclomatic complexity of this function is 1. The `SpringApplication.run()` method abstracts away most of the complexity, but the complexity of the entire Spring Boot framework initialization is significant.
*   **Pain Points:**

    The main pain point here is that it may be difficult to debug issues that occur during the Spring Boot application startup process. The `SpringApplication.run()` method performs a lot of behind-the-scenes work, so understanding exactly what is going on can be challenging. You can use debug logs to better understand it.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class DemoApplication {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
        }
    
    }
    ```
Here, `DemoApplication.class` tells Spring which class to use for scanning components and for configuration.
