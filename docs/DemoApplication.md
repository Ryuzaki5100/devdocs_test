## Function Documentation

This document provides detailed documentation for the functions in the `DemoApplication`, including explanations, business logic, and potential pain points. The functions are presented in the order of execution.

### 1. `DemoApplication.main(String[] args)`

**Description:**

The `main` function is the entry point of the Spring Boot application. It initializes and starts the Spring application context, which in turn manages the application's components, dependencies, and lifecycle.

**Signature:**

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

**Parameters:**

*   `String[] args`:  Command-line arguments passed to the application. These arguments can be used to configure the application's behavior or pass data to it.

**Functionality:**

The `main` function calls `SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args)`. This static method performs the following crucial steps:

1.  **Creates a Spring Application Context:**  It creates an instance of `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` (or a similar implementation) to serve as the core of the application. This context manages beans, their dependencies, and their lifecycle.
2.  **Registers the Application Class:** It registers `DemoApplication.class` as a configuration class. This tells Spring to scan this class (and potentially other classes in its package) for Spring annotations (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, `@Autowired`) to discover and manage beans.
3.  **Starts the Application:**  It starts the application context, which involves initializing all the beans, wiring dependencies, and starting any embedded servers (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) if the application is a web application.
4.  **Handles Command-Line Arguments:**  It processes any command-line arguments passed in the `args` array. These arguments can be used to override default configuration settings or pass data to the application.

**Business Logic:**

The business logic of the `main` method is essentially to bootstrap the entire Spring Boot application. It sets up the environment for the application to run, allowing other components to handle the actual business logic.  It's the foundation upon which the rest of the application logic is built. The actual business logic is implemented in other components of the Spring application (e.g., controllers, services, repositories).

**Example:**

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**Dependencies:**

The `main` function depends on `SpringApplication.run()`, which is part of the Spring Boot framework. It implicitly also depends on the `DemoApplication` class itself (and any classes it depends on), as it uses this class to configure and start the application context.

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**

The cyclomatic complexity of `main` function is 1. It simply calls `SpringApplication.run`.

**Pain Points:**

*   **Limited Customization:** The `main` method itself provides limited opportunities for customization.  Most of the application's configuration is done through Spring annotations and configuration files.
*   **Dependency on Spring Boot:** The application is tightly coupled to the Spring Boot framework.  This makes it more difficult to reuse parts of the application in other contexts.
*   **Debugging:** If the application fails to start, debugging can be challenging because the error might originate from anywhere within the application context initialization process.  Careful examination of logs and stack traces is necessary.
