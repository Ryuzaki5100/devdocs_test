## Function Documentation

This documentation details the provided functions, explaining their purpose, functionality, and relationships within the provided structure. We will follow a logical order of execution to explain how these functions might be used together.

**1. `BaseTask.__init__(self, task_id, python_callable)`**

```python
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, python_callable: Callable) -> None:
        self.task_id = task_id
        self.python_callable = python_callable
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the constructor (initializer) for the `BaseTask` class. It's responsible for setting up the basic attributes that all tasks will have in common.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `task_id` (str): A unique identifier for the task. This is crucial for tracking and managing tasks within a workflow.
    *   `python_callable` (Callable): A reference to the Python function that this task will execute when it's run. This allows the `BaseTask` to be associated with specific logic.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It assigns the provided `task_id` to the `self.task_id` attribute.
    *   It assigns the provided `python_callable` to the `self.python_callable` attribute.
*   **Business Logic:** The `BaseTask` class serves as an abstraction for all task types.  It holds the essential information needed to define and execute a task within a workflow.  By storing the `task_id` and `python_callable`, it provides a standardized way to manage and trigger task execution.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    def my_function():
        print("Hello from my_function!")

    base_task = BaseTask(task_id="my_task", python_callable=my_function)
    print(base_task.task_id)  # Output: my_task
    # Calling base_task.python_callable() would execute my_function
    ```

**2. `DataTask.__init__(self, task_id, data)`**

```python
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, data: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(task_id, self.process_data)
        self.data = data
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the constructor for the `DataTask` class, which inherits from `BaseTask`. It initializes a task specifically designed to process data.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `task_id` (str):  A unique identifier for the data task.
    *   `data` (str):  The data that this task will process.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It calls the `__init__` method of the parent class (`BaseTask`) using `super().__init__(task_id, self.process_data)`. This sets up the `task_id` and, importantly, sets the `python_callable` of the base class to `self.process_data`.  This means when the task is executed, the `process_data` method of the `DataTask` instance will be called.
    *   It assigns the provided `data` to the `self.data` attribute.
*   **Business Logic:** The `DataTask` represents a specific type of task focused on data manipulation. By inheriting from `BaseTask`, it reuses the basic task structure and adds data-specific functionality. The `data` attribute holds the information to be processed, and the `process_data` method (defined later) contains the actual processing logic.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    data_task = DataTask(task_id="process_customer_data", data="customer_details.csv")
    print(data_task.task_id)    # Output: process_customer_data
    print(data_task.data)        # Output: customer_details.csv
    ```

**3. `ComputeTask.__init__(self, task_id, operation)`**

```python
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, operation: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(task_id, self.process_compute)
        self.operation = operation
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the constructor for the `ComputeTask` class, inheriting from `BaseTask`. It initializes a task designed for performing computations.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `task_id` (str): A unique identifier for the compute task.
    *   `operation` (str): A string representing the computation to be performed (e.g., "calculate_average", "sum_values").
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It calls the `__init__` method of the parent class (`BaseTask`) using `super().__init__(task_id, self.process_compute)`. This initializes the `task_id` and sets the `python_callable` of the base class to `self.process_compute`. This ensures that when the task is executed, the `process_compute` method of the `ComputeTask` instance is called.
    *   It assigns the provided `operation` to the `self.operation` attribute.
*   **Business Logic:** The `ComputeTask` represents a task that performs some form of computation. Similar to `DataTask`, it inherits from `BaseTask` to reuse the base task structure. The `operation` attribute specifies the type of calculation to be performed, and the `process_compute` method (defined later) handles the actual computation logic.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    compute_task = ComputeTask(task_id="calculate_total", operation="sum_of_sales")
    print(compute_task.task_id)      # Output: calculate_total
    print(compute_task.operation)     # Output: sum_of_sales
    ```

**4. `DataTask.process_data(self)`**

```python
    def process_data(self) -> None:
        print(f" Processing data task {self.task_id} with data: {self.data}")
```

*   **Purpose:** This method defines the data processing logic for a `DataTask`.  It is the `python_callable` that is executed when the `DataTask` runs (as set in the `DataTask.__init__` method).
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `self`:  A reference to the `DataTask` instance.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It prints a message to the console indicating that the data task is being processed, including the `task_id` and the `data` associated with the task.
*   **Business Logic:** This is where the specific data processing steps would typically occur.  In this simplified example, it just prints a message.  In a real-world scenario, this method might load data from a file, transform it, clean it, or perform other data manipulation operations.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    data_task = DataTask(task_id="process_customer_data", data="customer_details.csv")
    data_task.process_data()  # Output: Processing data task process_customer_data with data: customer_details.csv
    ```

**5. `ComputeTask.process_compute(self)`**

```python
    def process_compute(self) -> None:
        print(f"Processing compute task {self.task_id} with operation: {self.operation}")
```

*   **Purpose:** This method defines the computation logic for a `ComputeTask`. It's the `python_callable` executed when the `ComputeTask` runs (as set in `ComputeTask.__init__`).
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `self`: A reference to the `ComputeTask` instance.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It prints a message to the console indicating that the compute task is being processed, including the `task_id` and the `operation` to be performed.
*   **Business Logic:**  This is where the actual computation would take place. In this simplified example, it only prints a message.  In a real-world scenario, this method might perform calculations, run simulations, or execute other computationally intensive tasks based on the `operation` attribute.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    compute_task = ComputeTask(task_id="calculate_total", operation="sum_of_sales")
    compute_task.process_compute() # Output: Processing compute task calculate_total with operation: sum_of_sales
    ```

**6. `BaseTask.create_task(self, dag)`**

```python
    def create_task(self, dag: DAG) -> PythonOperator:
        return PythonOperator(
            task_id=self.task_id,
            python_callable=self.python_callable,
            dag=dag,
        )
```

*   **Purpose:** This method creates an Airflow `PythonOperator` instance based on the `BaseTask`'s attributes. This allows the `BaseTask` to be integrated into an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `dag` (DAG): An Airflow `DAG` object to which the task will be added.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It creates a `PythonOperator` instance.
    *   It sets the `task_id` of the `PythonOperator` to the `task_id` of the `BaseTask`.
    *   It sets the `python_callable` of the `PythonOperator` to the `python_callable` of the `BaseTask`.  This connects the Airflow task to the actual function that will be executed.
    *   It associates the `PythonOperator` with the provided `dag`.
    *   It returns the created `PythonOperator`.
*   **Business Logic:**  This method bridges the gap between the `BaseTask` abstraction and the Airflow framework.  By creating a `PythonOperator`, it allows the task's logic (defined in `python_callable`) to be executed as part of an Airflow workflow. The `DAG` parameter ensures the task is properly integrated into the overall workflow.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    def my_function():
        print("Hello from my_function!")

    base_task = BaseTask(task_id="my_task", python_callable=my_function)

    with DAG(dag_id="my_dag", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval=None) as dag:
        task = base_task.create_task(dag) # creates a PythonOperator task
    ```

**Cyclomatic Complexity and Pain Points:**

*   **Low Cyclomatic Complexity:** The functions themselves have very low cyclomatic complexity. Each function primarily performs a single, straightforward operation (initialization or printing).
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   **Limited Functionality:** The `process_data` and `process_compute` methods currently only print messages. This is a major limitation as they don't actually perform any meaningful data processing or computation.  Expanding these methods with real-world logic would significantly increase the complexity.
    *   **String-Based Operations:** The `operation` attribute in `ComputeTask` is a string. This limits the flexibility and expressiveness of the computation. A better approach might be to use function objects or a more structured representation of the operation.
    *   **Error Handling:** There is no error handling in any of the functions. Adding error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) would make the code more robust.
    *   **Type Hinting:** While type hints are present, they are not consistently enforced. Consider using a tool like `mypy` to statically check the code for type errors.
    *   **Lack of Abstraction:** While `BaseTask` provides some abstraction, the concrete tasks (`DataTask`, `ComputeTask`) are still relatively simple.  More complex workflows might benefit from additional levels of abstraction and more specialized task types.
    *   **Tight Coupling to Airflow:** The `create_task` method directly creates an Airflow `PythonOperator`.  This makes the `BaseTask` class tightly coupled to Airflow.  If you wanted to use the tasks in a different workflow engine, you would need to modify the `create_task` method.

In summary, the provided code provides a basic framework for defining tasks. Expanding the functionality of `process_data` and `process_compute`, adding error handling, and improving the abstraction would significantly enhance the utility and robustness of the code.
