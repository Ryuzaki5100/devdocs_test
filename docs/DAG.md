## Function Documentation

This document provides detailed documentation for each function, following the order in which they are likely to be used or depend on each other. It includes explanations of their functionality, business logic, and potential areas for improvement.

**Execution Flow:**

The intended flow of execution is roughly as follows:

1.  `BaseTask.__init__` (Initialization of the base task with a task ID and a callable function).
2.  `DataTask.__init__` (Initialization of a data processing task, inheriting from `BaseTask`).
3.  `ComputeTask.__init__` (Initialization of a compute task, inheriting from `BaseTask`).
4.  `DataTask.process_data` (The actual data processing logic).
5.  `ComputeTask.process_compute` (The actual compute processing logic).
6.  `BaseTask.create_task` (Creation of an Airflow PythonOperator task).

### 1. `BaseTask.__init__(self, task_id, python_callable)`

**Function Name:** `BaseTask.__init__`

**Description:**
This is the constructor for the `BaseTask` class. It initializes the core attributes common to all tasks. It sets the `task_id` which uniquely identifies the task within the Airflow DAG, and the `python_callable` which is a reference to the function that will be executed when the task runs.

**Parameters:**

*   `task_id` (str): A string representing the unique identifier for the task.
*   `python_callable` (Callable): A callable object (e.g., a function or a method) that will be executed by the task.

**Body:**

```python
def __init__(self, task_id: str, python_callable: Callable) -> None:
    self.task_id = task_id
    self.python_callable = python_callable
```

**Business Logic:**

The primary purpose of this initializer is to set up the fundamental properties needed for any task. The `task_id` is crucial for Airflow to manage and track task execution. The `python_callable` encapsulates the specific logic that the task performs.

**Dependencies:**

*   None - This is the base initialization and doesn't depend on other custom functions.

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (simple assignment)

**Pain Points:**

*   Currently, there are no explicit type validations for `task_id` and `python_callable`. Adding type checks using `isinstance()` would improve robustness.
*   Error handling for invalid `python_callable` types is missing.
*   Could add a descriptive docstring to improve readability.

### 2. `DataTask.__init__(self, task_id, data)`

**Function Name:** `DataTask.__init__`

**Description:**
This is the constructor for the `DataTask` class, which inherits from `BaseTask`. It initializes a task designed for processing data. It calls the `BaseTask` constructor to set the `task_id` and the `python_callable` to `self.process_data`. It also stores the data to be processed in the `self.data` attribute.

**Parameters:**

*   `task_id` (str): A string representing the unique identifier for the task.
*   `data` (str):  A string representing the data that needs to be processed.

**Body:**

```python
def __init__(self, task_id: str, data: str) -> None:
    super().__init__(task_id, self.process_data)
    self.data = data
```

**Business Logic:**

This class represents a task that is specifically designed to handle data processing.  The `data` attribute holds the input data, and the `process_data` method (defined later) contains the logic to manipulate that data.  By inheriting from `BaseTask`, it reuses the common task initialization logic.

**Dependencies:**

*   `BaseTask.__init__`

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (simple assignment and super call)

**Pain Points:**

*   The `data` attribute is currently a string. This might be limiting; consider allowing other data types like dictionaries or lists, or providing a mechanism for type conversion.
*   There's no validation of the `data` format or content.  Depending on the expected data structure, validation would prevent unexpected errors.

### 3. `ComputeTask.__init__(self, task_id, operation)`

**Function Name:** `ComputeTask.__init__`

**Description:**
This is the constructor for the `ComputeTask` class, which also inherits from `BaseTask`.  It initializes a task designed for performing computations.  It calls the `BaseTask` constructor to set the `task_id` and the `python_callable` to `self.process_compute`. It also stores the operation to be performed in the `self.operation` attribute.

**Parameters:**

*   `task_id` (str): A string representing the unique identifier for the task.
*   `operation` (str): A string representing the operation to be performed.  This could be something like "sum", "average", etc.

**Body:**

```python
def __init__(self, task_id: str, operation: str) -> None:
    super().__init__(task_id, self.process_compute)
    self.operation = operation
```

**Business Logic:**

This class represents a task designed for computation. The `operation` attribute defines the type of computation to execute, and the `process_compute` method (defined later) implements this computation.  Inheritance from `BaseTask` ensures the common task structure is maintained.

**Dependencies:**

*   `BaseTask.__init__`

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (simple assignment and super call)

**Pain Points:**

*   The `operation` attribute is currently a string.  It might be better to use an enum or a more structured approach to represent the different types of operations, preventing typos and making the code more maintainable.
*   There is no mechanism to pass data to the `process_compute` function, so the compute task can't take any data to use for computation.

### 4. `DataTask.process_data(self)`

**Function Name:** `DataTask.process_data`

**Description:**
This method defines the data processing logic for a `DataTask`.  Currently, it simply prints a message to the console indicating that the task is processing data, along with the `task_id` and the `data` associated with the task.

**Parameters:**

*   `self` (DataTask):  A reference to the `DataTask` instance.

**Body:**

```python
def process_data(self) -> None:
    print(f" Processing data tas k {self.task_id} with data: {self.data}")
```

**Business Logic:**

This is where the core data processing would occur.  In a real-world scenario, this method would contain code to read data from a source, transform it, and potentially write it to a destination.  The current implementation is a placeholder for that more complex logic.

**Dependencies:**

*   None - only uses `self.task_id` and `self.data`

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (single print statement)

**Pain Points:**

*   This is a placeholder implementation.  The actual data processing logic is missing.
*   There's no error handling within this method.
*   The method assumes the data is already available in the `self.data` attribute. A more robust implementation might fetch the data from an external source.

### 5. `ComputeTask.process_compute(self)`

**Function Name:** `ComputeTask.process_compute`

**Description:**
This method defines the computation logic for a `ComputeTask`.  Currently, it simply prints a message to the console indicating that the task is performing a computation, along with the `task_id` and the `operation` associated with the task.

**Parameters:**

*   `self` (ComputeTask):  A reference to the `ComputeTask` instance.

**Body:**

```python
def process_compute(self) -> None:
    print(f"Processing compute task {self.task_id} with operation: {self.operation}")
```

**Business Logic:**

This is where the actual computation would be performed.  In a real-world scenario, this method would contain code to execute the specified `operation`. The current implementation is a placeholder.

**Dependencies:**

*   None - only uses `self.task_id` and `self.operation`

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (single print statement)

**Pain Points:**

*   This is a placeholder implementation. The actual computation logic is missing.
*   There's no error handling within this method.  For example, what happens if the `operation` is invalid?
*   No data is passed to this function to perform the compute.

### 6. `BaseTask.create_task(self, dag)`

**Function Name:** `BaseTask.create_task`

**Description:**
This method creates an Airflow `PythonOperator` task. It takes an Airflow `DAG` object as input and returns a `PythonOperator` instance. The `PythonOperator` is configured with the `task_id` and `python_callable` from the `BaseTask` instance, ensuring that the correct function is executed when the task runs in Airflow.

**Parameters:**

*   `self` (BaseTask): A reference to the `BaseTask` instance.
*   `dag` (DAG): An Airflow DAG object to which the task will be added.

**Body:**

```python
def create_task(self, dag: DAG) -> PythonOperator:
    return PythonOperator(
        task_id=self.task_id,
        python_callable=self.python_callable,
        dag=dag,
    )
```

**Business Logic:**

This function bridges the gap between the task definition (the `BaseTask` and its subclasses) and the Airflow environment.  It creates a concrete Airflow task that can be scheduled and executed as part of a DAG.

**Dependencies:**

*   `PythonOperator` (from `airflow.operators.python_operator`)
*   `DAG` (from `airflow`)
*   Relies on `self.task_id` and `self.python_callable` being correctly initialized.

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (single return statement constructing a PythonOperator)

**Pain Points:**

*   The method assumes that the `PythonOperator` is the appropriate operator for all tasks.  A more flexible design might allow for different operator types to be used.
*   There's no error handling if the `PythonOperator` cannot be created (e.g., due to invalid parameters).
*   The current implementation doesn't allow setting any other `PythonOperator` parameters (e.g., `op_kwargs`, `provide_context`).

**Summary of Pain Points and Improvements:**

1.  **Type Validation:** Add type validations using `isinstance()` in constructors to improve robustness.
2.  **Data Handling in `DataTask`:** Allow more flexible data types for the `data` attribute and implement data validation.
3.  **Operation Handling in `ComputeTask`:** Use an enum or structured approach for the `operation` attribute. Implement data passing mechanism.
4.  **Missing Logic:** Implement the actual data processing and computation logic in `process_data` and `process_compute`.
5.  **Error Handling:** Add error handling (try-except blocks) to `process_data`, `process_compute`, and `create_task`.
6.  **Flexibility in `create_task`:**  Allow different operator types to be used and enable setting other `PythonOperator` parameters.
7.  **Docstrings:** Add descriptive docstrings to all functions and classes.

By addressing these pain points, the code can be made more robust, flexible, and maintainable.
