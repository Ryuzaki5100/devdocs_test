## Function Documentation

This documentation outlines the provided functions, explaining their purpose, functionality, and relationships within a potential workflow.

**1. `BaseTask.__init__(self, task_id, python_callable)`**

```python
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, python_callable: Callable) -> None:
        self.task_id = task_id
        self.python_callable = python_callable
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the constructor for the `BaseTask` class. It initializes the basic attributes common to all task types.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `task_id` (str): A unique identifier for the task. This ID is used by the orchestration framework (likely Airflow, given the `DAG` reference later) to track and manage the task.
    *   `python_callable` (Callable): A reference to a Python function that will be executed when the task runs. This is the core logic of the task. It's a callable object (function, method, etc.).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It assigns the provided `task_id` to the `self.task_id` attribute, storing the task's identifier.
    *   It assigns the provided `python_callable` to the `self.python_callable` attribute, storing the function to be executed.
*   **Business Logic:**  This is the foundation for defining tasks. The `task_id` allows the orchestration system to uniquely identify and manage each task. The `python_callable` encapsulates the specific work that needs to be performed.
*   **Dependencies:**  None directly. This is the base class constructor.  It is conceptually `func1`.
*   **Example:**

    ```python
    def my_function():
        print("Hello from my task!")

    base_task = BaseTask("my_task", my_function)
    print(base_task.task_id)  # Output: my_task
    ```

**2. `DataTask.__init__(self, task_id, data)`**

```python
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, data: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(task_id, self.process_data)
        self.data = data
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the constructor for the `DataTask` class, which inherits from `BaseTask`. It initializes a task specifically designed to process data.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `task_id` (str): A unique identifier for the data processing task.
    *   `data` (str): The data that this task will process.  In a real-world scenario, this might be a file path, a database query, or data fetched from an API.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It calls the `BaseTask` constructor using `super().__init__(task_id, self.process_data)`. This initializes the `task_id` and sets the `python_callable` of the base class to `self.process_data`.  This means that when this task is executed by the orchestration framework, the `process_data` method will be called.
    *   It assigns the provided `data` to the `self.data` attribute, storing the data to be processed.
*   **Business Logic:** This task represents an operation that manipulates or transforms data. The `data` attribute holds the input for the processing, and the `process_data` method (defined later) implements the data processing logic.
*   **Dependencies:** `BaseTask.__init__`.
*   **Example:**

    ```python
    data_task = DataTask("process_file", "/path/to/my/file.txt")
    print(data_task.task_id) # Output: process_file
    ```

**3. `ComputeTask.__init__(self, task_id, operation)`**

```python
    def __init__(self, task_id: str, operation: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(task_id, self.process_compute)
        self.operation = operation
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the constructor for the `ComputeTask` class, which also inherits from `BaseTask`. It initializes a task designed to perform a computation.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `task_id` (str): A unique identifier for the compute task.
    *   `operation` (str): A description of the computation to be performed.  In a more realistic setting, this might be a mathematical expression, a function name, or a configuration setting for a computation.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It calls the `BaseTask` constructor using `super().__init__(task_id, self.process_compute)`. This initializes the `task_id` and sets the `python_callable` to `self.process_compute`.  This means that when the task is executed, the `process_compute` method will be invoked.
    *   It assigns the provided `operation` to the `self.operation` attribute, storing the description of the computation.
*   **Business Logic:** This task represents a computational step in a workflow. The `operation` attribute provides context for the computation, and the `process_compute` method (defined later) executes the actual computation.
*   **Dependencies:** `BaseTask.__init__`.
*   **Example:**

    ```python
    compute_task = ComputeTask("calculate_average", "Average of sales data")
    print(compute_task.task_id) # Output: calculate_average
    ```

**4. `DataTask.process_data(self)`**

```python
    def process_data(self) -> None:
        print(f" Processing data tas k {self.task_id} with data: {self.data}")
```

*   **Purpose:** This method defines the logic for processing data within a `DataTask`.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `self`:  Refers to the instance of the `DataTask` class.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It prints a message to the console indicating that the data processing task is running, including the `task_id` and the data being processed. **Note:** In a real application, this method would contain the actual data processing logic (e.g., reading a file, transforming data, writing to a database).  The current implementation only prints a message.
*   **Business Logic:** This method embodies the data transformation or manipulation step. It would typically involve reading data from a source, performing operations on the data (cleaning, filtering, aggregating), and potentially writing the processed data to a destination.
*   **Dependencies:** None, but it relies on the `self.data` attribute being initialized in the `DataTask.__init__` method.
*   **Example:**

    ```python
    data_task = DataTask("process_file", "/path/to/my/file.txt")
    data_task.process_data() # Output: Processing data task process_file with data: /path/to/my/file.txt
    ```

**5. `ComputeTask.process_compute(self)`**

```python
    def process_compute(self) -> None:
        print(f"Processing compute task {self.task_id} with operation: {self.operation}")
```

*   **Purpose:** This method defines the logic for performing a computation within a `ComputeTask`.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `self`: Refers to the instance of the `ComputeTask` class.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It prints a message to the console indicating that the compute task is running, including the `task_id` and the description of the operation.  **Note:**  In a real application, this method would contain the actual computation logic (e.g., mathematical calculations, model training, complex algorithms). The current implementation only prints a message.
*   **Business Logic:** This method represents the computational step in a workflow. It would typically involve taking input data, performing calculations or algorithms, and producing a result.
*   **Dependencies:** None, but it relies on the `self.operation` attribute being initialized in the `ComputeTask.__init__` method.
*   **Example:**

    ```python
    compute_task = ComputeTask("calculate_average", "Average of sales data")
    compute_task.process_compute() # Output: Processing compute task calculate_average with operation: Average of sales data
    ```

**6. `BaseTask.create_task(self, dag)`**

```python
    def create_task(self, dag: DAG) -> PythonOperator:
        return PythonOperator(
            task_id=self.task_id,
            python_callable=self.python_callable,
            dag=dag,
        )
```

*   **Purpose:** This method creates an Airflow `PythonOperator` instance, which represents the task within an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).  This allows the task to be executed as part of an Airflow workflow.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `dag` (DAG): An Airflow `DAG` object, representing the workflow to which this task will be added.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It creates a `PythonOperator` object.
    *   It sets the `task_id` of the `PythonOperator` to the `self.task_id` of the `BaseTask` instance.
    *   It sets the `python_callable` of the `PythonOperator` to the `self.python_callable` of the `BaseTask` instance. This connects the function to be executed with the Airflow task.
    *   It sets the `dag` of the `PythonOperator` to the provided `dag` object, associating the task with the specified Airflow DAG.
    *   It returns the created `PythonOperator` object.
*   **Business Logic:**  This is the integration point with Airflow. It converts the abstract `BaseTask` (or its subclasses) into a concrete Airflow task that can be scheduled and executed as part of a larger data pipeline.
*   **Dependencies:** Requires the `PythonOperator` class from the Airflow library. It relies on the `self.task_id` and `self.python_callable` attributes being initialized in the `BaseTask.__init__` method. This conceptually maps to `func2`.
*   **Example:**

    ```python
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    def my_function():
        print("Hello from Airflow task!")

    base_task = BaseTask("airflow_task", my_function)

    with DAG(
        dag_id="my_dag",
        start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
        schedule_interval=None,
    ) as dag:
        airflow_task = base_task.create_task(dag)
    ```

### Overall Business Logic and Workflow

These functions, taken together, define a pattern for creating and managing tasks within a data pipeline or workflow. The `BaseTask` provides a common foundation, while `DataTask` and `ComputeTask` represent specific types of tasks. The `create_task` method allows these tasks to be integrated into an Airflow workflow.

A typical workflow might involve:

1.  Creating instances of `DataTask` to load, clean, and transform data.
2.  Creating instances of `ComputeTask` to perform calculations or analysis on the data.
3.  Using `create_task` to generate Airflow `PythonOperator` objects for each task.
4.  Defining dependencies between the tasks in an Airflow DAG to create a complete data pipeline.

### Cyclomatic Complexity

The cyclomatic complexity of each function is relatively low (1 or 2), as they mostly consist of simple assignments or a single print statement. However, the *potential* complexity lies within the `process_data` and `process_compute` methods. The current implementations are trivial (just printing a message), but in a real-world scenario, these methods could contain complex data processing or computational logic, leading to higher cyclomatic complexity.

### Pain Points

1.  **Lack of Concrete Implementation:** The `process_data` and `process_compute` methods are placeholders. The code lacks the actual logic for data processing and computation, making it difficult to evaluate the real-world usability and performance.

2.  **String-Based Data and Operation:**  Using strings to represent data and operations is limiting. A more robust design would use appropriate data structures (e.g., dictionaries, lists, objects) and function references or command patterns to define operations.

3.  **Error Handling:** There is no error handling in the provided code. In a production environment, it is crucial to handle exceptions and log errors to ensure the reliability of the workflow.

4.  **Testability:** The current code is difficult to test due to the reliance on printing to the console.  A better design would use return values or mockable dependencies to facilitate unit testing.

5. **Loose Coupling:** The `data` and `operation` attributes are loosely typed which could cause type errors during runtime
