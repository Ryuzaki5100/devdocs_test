## Cube Class Documentation

This document provides detailed documentation for the `Cube` class and its methods. The class seems to represent the state and operations of a Rubik's Cube.

**Function 1: `Cube.getEdge()`**

```java
public Edge getEdge() {
    return edge;
}
```

*   **Description:** This getter method returns the `Edge` object associated with the `Cube` instance. The `Edge` object likely encapsulates the state of the edges of the Rubik's Cube, including their position and orientation.
*   **Business Logic:**  It provides access to the edge data of the cube, enabling other methods or classes to inspect or modify the edge configuration. This is fundamental for performing moves and checking the cube's state.
*   **Dependencies:** This method has dependencies on `edge` field, which are `func8, func5, func9, func6, func7, func3, func2, func4` since `edge` object creation might depend on these.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very simple getter method)
*   **Pain Points:** None. It's a standard getter.

**Function 2: `Cube.getCorner()`**

```java
public Corner getCorner() {
    return corner;
}
```

*   **Description:** This getter method returns the `Corner` object associated with the `Cube` instance. The `Corner` object likely encapsulates the state of the corners of the Rubik's Cube, including their position and orientation.
*   **Business Logic:**  It provides access to the corner data of the cube, enabling other methods or classes to inspect or modify the corner configuration. This is fundamental for performing moves and checking the cube's state.
*   **Dependencies:** This method has dependencies on `corner` field, which are `func8, func5, func9, func6, func1, func7, func3, func4` since `corner` object creation might depend on these.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very simple getter method)
*   **Pain Points:** None. It's a standard getter.

**Function 3: `Cube.setEdge(Edge edge)`**

```java
public void setEdge(Edge edge) {
    this.edge = edge;
}
```

*   **Description:** This setter method sets the `Edge` object for the `Cube` instance.  It updates the cube's edge configuration with the provided `Edge` object.
*   **Business Logic:**  Allows modification of the cube's edge state. This is crucial for applying moves to the cube.
*   **Dependencies:** This method has dependencies on `edge` field, which are `func8, func5, func9, func6, func1, func7, func2, func4`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very simple setter method)
*   **Pain Points:** None. It's a standard setter.

**Function 4: `Cube.setCorner(Corner corner)`**

```java
public void setCorner(Corner corner) {
    this.corner = corner;
}
```

*   **Description:** This setter method sets the `Corner` object for the `Cube` instance. It updates the cube's corner configuration with the provided `Corner` object.
*   **Business Logic:**  Allows modification of the cube's corner state. This is crucial for applying moves to the cube.
*   **Dependencies:** This method has dependencies on `corner` field, which are `func8, func5, func9, func6, func1, func7, func3, func2`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very simple setter method)
*   **Pain Points:** None. It's a standard setter.

**Function 5: `Cube.clone()`**

```java
public Cube clone() {
    return new Cube(this.getEdge().clone(), this.getCorner().clone());
}
```

*   **Description:** Creates and returns a deep copy of the `Cube` object. It clones both the `Edge` and `Corner` objects to ensure that the copy is independent of the original.
*   **Business Logic:**  Essential for creating temporary copies of the cube state during move execution or algorithm analysis, preventing modification of the original cube.
*   **Dependencies:** This method has dependencies on `getEdge()`, `getCorner()`, `Edge.clone()`, and `Corner.clone()`. Therefore, it indirectly depends on `func8, func9, func6, func1, func7, func3, func2, func4`
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1
*   **Pain Points:** Relies on the `clone()` methods of the `Edge` and `Corner` classes being implemented correctly for a deep copy. If `Edge.clone()` or `Corner.clone()` perform shallow copies, this method will also perform a shallow copy, leading to potential issues.

**Function 6: `Cube.execute(Cube c, String s)`**

```java
public Cube execute(Cube c, String s) {
    Cube temp = c.clone();
    String[] moves = s.split(" ");
    if (moves.length > 1) {
        StringBuilder sBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (String string : moves) {
            if (string.length() == 1)
                sBuilder.append(string.charAt(0));
            else if (string.charAt(1) == '2')
                sBuilder.append(String.valueOf(string.charAt(0)).repeat(2));
            else
                sBuilder.append(String.valueOf(string.charAt(0)).repeat(3));
        }
        s = sBuilder.toString();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        EdgePos edgePos = temp.getEdge().getEdgePos().clone();
        EdgeOrientation edgeOrientation = temp.getEdge().getEdgeOrientation().clone();
        for (int j = 0; j < 12; j++) {
            edgeOrientation.setVal(j, nextEdgeOrientation.get(ch).get(edgePos.getVal()[j]).get(edgeOrientation.getVal()[j]));
            edgePos.setVal(j, nextEdgePos.get(ch).getVal()[edgePos.getVal()[j]]);
        }
        temp.setEdge(new Edge(edgePos, edgeOrientation));
        CornerPos cornerPos = temp.getCorner().getCornerPos().clone();
        CornerOrientation cornerOrientation = temp.getCorner().getCornerOrientation().clone();
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            cornerOrientation.setVal(j, nextCornerOrientation.get(ch).get(cornerPos.getVal()[j]).get(cornerOrientation.getVal()[j]));
            cornerPos.setVal(j, nextCornerPos.get(ch).getVal()[cornerPos.getVal()[j]]);
        }
        temp.setCorner(new Corner(cornerPos, cornerOrientation));
    }
    return temp;
}
```

*   **Description:** This method executes a sequence of moves on a given `Cube` object. It takes a `Cube` object and a string `s` representing the moves to be executed. The moves are applied sequentially to a copy of the input cube, and the resulting cube is returned. The method handles move notation with single turns, double turns ("2"), and inverse turns (represented by repeating the move three times - "'").
*   **Business Logic:**  The core method for applying moves to the cube. It simulates the physical rotation of cube faces and updates the internal representation of the cube's state accordingly.  This is the foundation for solving algorithms, scrambling, and any cube manipulation.
*   **Dependencies:** This method depends on `Cube.clone()`, `String.split()`, `Edge.getEdgePos()`, `Edge.getEdgeOrientation()`, `Corner.getCornerPos()`, `Corner.getCornerOrientation()`, `EdgePos.clone()`, `EdgeOrientation.clone()`, `CornerPos.clone()`, `CornerOrientation.clone()`, `EdgeOrientation.setVal()`, `EdgePos.setVal()`, `CornerOrientation.setVal()`, `CornerPos.setVal()`, `Cube.setEdge()`, `Cube.setCorner()`.  It also depends heavily on `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextEdgePos`, `nextCornerOrientation`, and `nextCornerPos` which are likely static data structures mapping moves to permutation and orientation changes.  Therefore, it has dependencies `func8, func5, func9, func1, func7, func3, func2, func4`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:**  High.  The method contains nested loops and conditional statements. Specifically, there's an outer loop iterating through the moves, and inner loops iterating through the edge and corner pieces. The conditional logic for parsing move notation also adds to the complexity.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   The nested loops make this method computationally expensive, especially for long move sequences.
    *   The hardcoded numbers (12 for edges, 8 for corners) could be replaced with constants for better readability and maintainability.
    *   The reliance on external data structures (`nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextEdgePos`, `nextCornerOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`) makes it difficult to understand the logic without knowing how these data structures are initialized and organized. The data structures and their access patterns should be well-documented.
    *   The parsing of the move string is rudimentary. A more robust parser could handle more complex move notations.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Cube solvedCube = new Cube(new Edge(new EdgePos(), new EdgeOrientation()), new Corner(new CornerPos(), new CornerOrientation())); // Assuming a solved cube is initialized this way
    Cube scrambledCube = Cube.execute(solvedCube, "R U R' U'");
    ```

**Function 7: `Cube.reverseAlgorithm(String s)`**

```java
public String reverseAlgorithm(String s) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) result.append(String.valueOf(s.charAt(i)).repeat(3));
    return new StringBuilder(result.toString()).reverse().toString();
}
```

*   **Description:** This method takes a move sequence string `s` and returns its reversed inverse.  It first converts each move to its inverse move by repeating the character 3 times. Then, it reverses the entire sequence.
*   **Business Logic:**  This is useful for generating the inverse of an algorithm, which is often needed in solving methods. If a sequence of moves scrambles a cube, its reversed inverse will solve it (or at least undo the scrambling).
*   **Dependencies:** `func8, func5, func9, func6, func1, func3, func2, func4`
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1
*   **Pain Points:** The inverse is achieved by repeating each move three times, which assumes that repeating a move three times is its inverse. This works for quarter turns but wouldn't correctly invert other types of moves (e.g. middle layer turns or wide moves). A more general solution would require a move-to-inverse mapping. It lacks error handling, does not validate input.

    Example:

    ```java
    String algorithm = "R U R'";
    String reversedInverse = Cube.reverseAlgorithm(algorithm);
    System.out.println(reversedInverse); // Output: '''R'''U'''R
    ```

**Function 8: `Cube.toString()`**

```java
public String toString() {
    return "Cube{\n" + "edge=" + edge.toString() + ",\ncorner=" + corner.toString() + "\n}";
}
```

*   **Description:**  This method overrides the default `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the `Cube` object.  It includes the string representation of the `Edge` and `Corner` objects.
*   **Business Logic:**  Useful for debugging and logging.  Allows easy inspection of the cube's state by printing it to the console or including it in log files.
*   **Dependencies:** This method depends on `edge.toString()` and `corner.toString()`. Therefore it depends on  `func5, func9, func6, func1, func7, func3, func2, func4`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1
*   **Pain Points:** Relies on the `toString()` methods of the `Edge` and `Corner` classes being implemented meaningfully. A clearer representation of the cube's current state can be provided.

**Function 9: `Cube.getAlgorithm(String moves)`**

```java
public ArrayList<String> getAlgorithm(String moves) {
    class Temp {

        final char ch;

        final byte b;

        public Temp(char ch, byte b) {
            this.ch = ch;
            this.b = b;
        }
    }
    Stack<Temp> s = new Stack<>();
    ArrayList<String> v = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("", "", "2", "'"));
    ArrayList<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++) {
        if (s.isEmpty() || s.peek().ch != moves.charAt(i))
            s.push(new Temp(moves.charAt(i), (byte) 1));
        else {
            Temp x = s.pop();
            if (x.b != (byte) 3)
                s.push(new Temp(x.ch, (byte) (x.b + 1)));
        }
    }
    while (!s.isEmpty()) {
        Temp x = s.pop();
        if (x.b != 0)
            result.add(0, x.ch + v.get(x.b));
    }
    return result;
}
```

*   **Description:** This method takes a string of moves as input (e.g., "RRRUU") and converts it into a standard Rubik's Cube algorithm notation (e.g., ["R'", "U2"]). It uses a stack to combine consecutive moves of the same face into a single move with the appropriate notation.
*   **Business Logic:** Used to simplify and present move sequences in a human-readable format. It takes a raw string of moves and converts them to the standard notation, where "2" represents a double turn, and "'" represents a counter-clockwise turn.
*   **Dependencies:**  It depends on `func8, func5, func6, func1, func7, func3, func2, func4`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Moderate. The presence of a `while` loop, an `if-else` inside `for` loop increases the complexity.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   The inner `Temp` class is tightly coupled with this method and could be moved outside the method or the logic streamlined to avoid the need for an inner class.
    *   It assumes that the input string only contains valid move characters. Input validation would improve robustness.
    *   The use of magic numbers (0, 1, 3) makes the code less readable. Using named constants would improve clarity.

*Example:*

```java
String moves = "RRRUU";
ArrayList<String> algorithm = cube.getAlgorithm(moves);
System.out.println(algorithm); // Output: [R', U2]
```

In summary, the `Cube` class provides the fundamental operations for representing and manipulating a Rubik's Cube. The `execute` method is central to applying moves, while `clone`, `getEdge`, `getCorner`, `setEdge`, `setCorner`, `toString`, `reverseAlgorithm` and `getAlgorithm` support various aspects of cube state management and algorithm manipulation. Careful attention should be paid to the efficiency of the `execute` method and the robustness of the move parsing and inverse generation logic.
