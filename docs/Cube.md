## Cube Class Documentation

This document provides detailed explanations for each function within the `Cube` class. The functions are presented in a logical order, starting with simple getter/setter methods and progressing to more complex operations like move execution and algorithm parsing.

**Data Members (Assumed):**

*   `edge`: An `Edge` object representing the edge positions and orientations of the cube.
*   `corner`: A `Corner` object representing the corner positions and orientations of the cube.
*   `nextEdgePos`: (Assumed) A data structure (likely a Map) storing the next edge positions after a move.  Indexed by move character (e.g., 'U', 'R', 'F', etc.) and the current edge position.
*   `nextEdgeOrientation`: (Assumed) A data structure (likely a Map) storing the next edge orientations after a move. Indexed by move character, current edge position, and current edge orientation.
*   `nextCornerPos`: (Assumed) A data structure (likely a Map) storing the next corner positions after a move, similar to `nextEdgePos`.
*   `nextCornerOrientation`: (Assumed) A data structure (likely a Map) storing the next corner orientations after a move, similar to `nextEdgeOrientation`.

**1. `Cube.getEdge()`**

```java
public Edge getEdge() {
    return edge;
}
```

*   **Description:** This function is a simple getter method.  It returns the `edge` object associated with the `Cube` instance.
*   **Business Logic:** Provides access to the `edge` state of the cube. This is fundamental for inspecting the current configuration of the cube's edges.  It's a building block for any algorithm or function that needs to understand the edge configuration.
*   **Dependencies:** `edge` data member.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a standard getter.

**2. `Cube.getCorner()`**

```java
public Corner getCorner() {
    return corner;
}
```

*   **Description:** This function is a simple getter method. It returns the `corner` object associated with the `Cube` instance.
*   **Business Logic:**  Provides access to the `corner` state of the cube. This is fundamental for inspecting the current configuration of the cube's corners. It's a building block for any algorithm or function that needs to understand the corner configuration.
*   **Dependencies:** `corner` data member.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a standard getter.

**3. `Cube.setEdge(Edge edge)`**

```java
public void setEdge(Edge edge) {
    this.edge = edge;
}
```

*   **Description:** This function is a simple setter method. It sets the `edge` object of the `Cube` instance to the given `edge` object.
*   **Business Logic:**  Allows modification of the cube's edge state. This is crucial for applying moves to the cube and updating its configuration.
*   **Dependencies:** `edge` data member.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a standard setter.

**4. `Cube.setCorner(Corner corner)`**

```java
public void setCorner(Corner corner) {
    this.corner = corner;
}
```

*   **Description:** This function is a simple setter method. It sets the `corner` object of the `Cube` instance to the given `corner` object.
*   **Business Logic:** Allows modification of the cube's corner state. This is crucial for applying moves to the cube and updating its configuration.
*   **Dependencies:** `corner` data member.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a standard setter.

**5. `Cube.clone()`**

```java
public Cube clone() {
    return new Cube(this.getEdge().clone(), this.getCorner().clone());
}
```

*   **Description:** Creates a deep copy of the `Cube` object.  It creates a new `Cube` instance and copies the `Edge` and `Corner` objects by calling their respective `clone()` methods.
*   **Business Logic:**  Essential for operations that need to work on a copy of the cube without modifying the original.  This is particularly important for searching algorithms or applying moves temporarily to explore different possibilities.
*   **Dependencies:** `getEdge()`, `getCorner()`, `Edge.clone()`, `Corner.clone()`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:**  Relies on the correct implementation of `Edge.clone()` and `Corner.clone()` for creating truly independent copies. If those clone methods are shallow copies, this function will also result in a shallow copy, leading to unexpected behavior.

**6. `Cube.toString()`**

```java
public String toString() {
    return "Cube{\n" + "edge=" + edge.toString() + ",\ncorner=" + corner.toString() + "\n}";
}
```

*   **Description:** Returns a string representation of the `Cube` object, including the string representations of its `edge` and `corner` components.
*   **Business Logic:**  Useful for debugging and logging.  It provides a human-readable representation of the cube's state.
*   **Dependencies:** `edge.toString()`, `corner.toString()`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:**  The readability of the output depends on the `toString()` implementations of the `Edge` and `Corner` classes.

**7. `Cube.reverseAlgorithm(String s)`**

```java
public String reverseAlgorithm(String s) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) result.append(String.valueOf(s.charAt(i)).repeat(3));
    return new StringBuilder(result.toString()).reverse().toString();
}
```

*   **Description:** This function takes a string `s` representing a sequence of moves and effectively triples each move, then reverses the entire sequence. The original intent seems to be creating the inverse move sequence assuming a specific move encoding.
*   **Business Logic:**  This aims to generate the inverse sequence of moves, which undoes the original sequence. This is used to revert the cube to its original state after applying a set of moves. The tripling of characters is a workaround, possibly because the initial move sequence was encoded in a way that a single character represents a 90-degree turn, and tripling it creates the reverse (270-degree turn, same as -90 degree).
*   **Dependencies:** None.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (low)
*   **Pain Points:** The tripling logic is very specific and depends on the encoding of moves. It assumes that a single move character represents a 90-degree turn and that a reversed move is equivalent to performing it three times. A cleaner approach would be to decode the sequence into a list of individual moves and apply the correct inverse (e.g., turning U to U').

**8. `Cube.getAlgorithm(String moves)`**

```java
public ArrayList<String> getAlgorithm(String moves) {
    class Temp {

        final char ch;

        final byte b;

        public Temp(char ch, byte b) {
            this.ch = ch;
            this.b = b;
        }
    }
    Stack<Temp> s = new Stack<>();
    ArrayList<String> v = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("", "", "2", "'"));
    ArrayList<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++) {
        if (s.isEmpty() || s.peek().ch != moves.charAt(i))
            s.push(new Temp(moves.charAt(i), (byte) 1));
        else {
            Temp x = s.pop();
            if (x.b != (byte) 3)
                s.push(new Temp(x.ch, (byte) (x.b + 1)));
        }
    }
    while (!s.isEmpty()) {
        Temp x = s.pop();
        if (x.b != 0)
            result.add(0, x.ch + v.get(x.b));
    }
    return result;
}
```

*   **Description:** This function takes a string `moves` representing a sequence of single-character move notations (e.g., "UUURFF") and converts it into a more standard Rubik's Cube move notation (e.g., ["U2", "R", "F2"]). It uses a stack to combine consecutive moves of the same face.
*   **Business Logic:** This function is a move compression/formatting utility.  Rubik's Cube algorithms are often represented with notations like "U2", "R'", or "F". This function aims to take a raw move sequence and format it.
*   **Dependencies:** `Stack`, `ArrayList`, `Arrays`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Medium. The loop and conditional statements increase the complexity.
*   **Pain Points:**  The use of a local class `Temp` could be avoided. The logic, while functional, could be made more readable.  Using an enum for the move multipliers (1, 2, ' ) would improve readability and maintainability.
    *   The `v` ArrayList represents `""`, `""`, `"2"`, and `"'"`. The empty strings at indices 0 and 1 seem unnecessary.

**9. `Cube.execute(Cube c, String s)`**

```java
public Cube execute(Cube c, String s) {
    Cube temp = c.clone();
    String[] moves = s.split(" ");
    if (moves.length > 1) {
        StringBuilder sBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (String string : moves) {
            if (string.length() == 1)
                sBuilder.append(string.charAt(0));
            else if (string.charAt(1) == '2')
                sBuilder.append(String.valueOf(string.charAt(0)).repeat(2));
            else
                sBuilder.append(String.valueOf(string.charAt(0)).repeat(3));
        }
        s = sBuilder.toString();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        EdgePos edgePos = temp.getEdge().getEdgePos().clone();
        EdgeOrientation edgeOrientation = temp.getEdge().getEdgeOrientation().clone();
        for (int j = 0; j < 12; j++) {
            edgeOrientation.setVal(j, nextEdgeOrientation.get(ch).get(edgePos.getVal()[j]).get(edgeOrientation.getVal()[j]));
            edgePos.setVal(j, nextEdgePos.get(ch).getVal()[edgePos.getVal()[j]]);
        }
        temp.setEdge(new Edge(edgePos, edgeOrientation));
        CornerPos cornerPos = temp.getCorner().getCornerPos().clone();
        CornerOrientation cornerOrientation = temp.getCorner().getCornerOrientation().clone();
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            cornerOrientation.setVal(j, nextCornerOrientation.get(ch).get(cornerPos.getVal()[j]).get(cornerOrientation.getVal()[j]));
            cornerPos.setVal(j, nextCornerPos.get(ch).getVal()[cornerPos.getVal()[j]]);
        }
        temp.setCorner(new Corner(cornerPos, cornerOrientation));
    }
    return temp;
}
```

*   **Description:** This function applies a sequence of moves `s` to a cube `c` and returns the resulting cube.  It handles both single-character move sequences (e.g., "UFR") and space-separated move notations (e.g., "U F R U2 R'").
*   **Business Logic:** This is the core move execution function. It takes a `Cube` object and a string representing a move sequence, and it simulates the moves on the cube, updating the edge and corner positions and orientations.  The `nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, and `nextCornerOrientation` data structures are *critical* to this function's operation, as they encode the transition rules for each move.
*   **Dependencies:** `clone()`, `getEdge()`, `setEdge()`, `getCorner()`, `setCorner()`, `EdgePos.clone()`, `EdgeOrientation.clone()`, `CornerPos.clone()`, `CornerOrientation.clone()`, `nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, `nextCornerOrientation`. Assumes `EdgePos`, `EdgeOrientation`, `CornerPos`, and `CornerOrientation` classes have a `getVal()` and `setVal()` method to access and modify values at specified indexes.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** High.  The nested loops and conditional statements contribute to a high cyclomatic complexity.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   **Readability:** The nested loops and the chained `get()` calls on the `next...` data structures make the code difficult to read and understand.
    *   **Maintainability:**  The hardcoded numbers `12` and `8` (for the number of edges and corners) should be replaced with named constants.  The logic for handling different move notations is repeated, which could be factored out into a separate function.
    *   **Error Handling:**  The code doesn't handle invalid move characters or incorrect input formats. This could lead to unexpected behavior.  The code assumes a correct input and mapping on the `next...` attributes.
    *   **Performance:** The repeated cloning of `EdgePos`, `EdgeOrientation`, `CornerPos`, and `CornerOrientation` within the loop could be a performance bottleneck. It may be possible to optimize this by modifying the objects in place (if that's safe and doesn't break other parts of the application).
    *   **General Design:** Reliance on external data structures (e.g. Maps) like `nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, and `nextCornerOrientation` makes the function more brittle. If these are not properly initialized or if they contain errors, the entire algorithm will fail. A more object-oriented approach could encapsulate the move logic within the `Edge` and `Corner` classes themselves.

**Summary of Cyclomatic Complexity and Pain Points:**

The code has a mix of functions with low complexity (getters/setters) and higher complexity (move execution and algorithm parsing). The `execute()` function is the most complex and presents the greatest challenges in terms of readability, maintainability, and potential performance bottlenecks. The `reverseAlgorithm()` function needs revisiting to ensure the underlying logic is correct, clearly understandable, and independent of the internal move representation. The `getAlgorithm()` could be refactored to improve readability and maintainability by avoiding the local class and improving the expression of the core algorithm.
