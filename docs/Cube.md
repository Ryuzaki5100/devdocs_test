## Function Documentation

This documentation details the functionality of each method within the `Cube` class, outlining their purpose, parameters, return values, and internal workings. We'll proceed in a logical order, starting with the simplest accessor methods and progressing to more complex operations like algorithm execution.

**1. `Cube.getEdge()`**

*   **Purpose:** This method serves as an accessor, providing direct access to the `edge` property of a `Cube` object. The `edge` property presumably represents the edge permutation and orientation of the cube.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Return Value:** An `Edge` object representing the current edge configuration of the cube.
*   **Functionality:** It simply returns the value of the `edge` instance variable.
*   **Business Logic:** In the context of a Rubik's Cube solver or simulator, the `Edge` object encapsulates the state of the 12 edges of the cube. This method allows other parts of the system to inspect this state.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Edge currentEdgeState = myCube.getEdge();
    ```
    This line would retrieve the Edge object associated with the Cube object `myCube`.
*   **Dependencies:** Depends on `Edge` class.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple getter method.

**2. `Cube.getCorner()`**

*   **Purpose:** This method acts as an accessor, returning the `corner` property of the `Cube` object. The `corner` property likely represents the corner permutation and orientation.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Return Value:** A `Corner` object representing the current corner configuration of the cube.
*   **Functionality:** The method returns the value of the `corner` instance variable.
*   **Business Logic:** Similar to `getEdge()`, this provides access to the state of the 8 corners of the Rubik's Cube.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Corner currentCornerState = myCube.getCorner();
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** Depends on `Corner` class.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple getter method.

**3. `Cube.setEdge(Edge edge)`**

*   **Purpose:** This method acts as a mutator, allowing the `edge` property of the `Cube` object to be set to a new value.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `edge`: An `Edge` object representing the desired new edge configuration.
*   **Return Value:** None (void)
*   **Functionality:** It sets the `edge` instance variable to the value provided as a parameter.
*   **Business Logic:** This method enables modification of the cube's edge configuration. It's a crucial part of implementing moves on the cube.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Edge newEdgeState = new Edge(...); // Create a new Edge object
    myCube.setEdge(newEdgeState); // Update the cube's edge state
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** Depends on `Edge` class.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple setter method.

**4. `Cube.setCorner(Corner corner)`**

*   **Purpose:** This method acts as a mutator, allowing the `corner` property of the `Cube` object to be set to a new value.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `corner`: A `Corner` object representing the desired new corner configuration.
*   **Return Value:** None (void)
*   **Functionality:** It sets the `corner` instance variable to the value passed in as a parameter.
*   **Business Logic:** This method enables modification of the cube's corner configuration.  Like `setEdge()`, it's vital for implementing cube moves.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Corner newCornerState = new Corner(...); // Create a new Corner object
    myCube.setCorner(newCornerState); // Update the cube's corner state
    ```
*   **Dependencies:** Depends on `Corner` class.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple setter method.

**5. `Cube.clone()`**

*   **Purpose:** Creates a deep copy of the `Cube` object.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Return Value:** A new `Cube` object that is a deep copy of the original.
*   **Functionality:** It creates new `Edge` and `Corner` objects by calling the `clone()` method on the existing `Edge` and `Corner` objects. It then constructs a new `Cube` object using these cloned `Edge` and `Corner` objects.
*   **Business Logic:** This method is essential for creating a copy of the cube's state *before* applying a move. This allows algorithms to explore different move sequences without modifying the original cube.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Cube originalCube = new Cube(...);
    Cube clonedCube = originalCube.clone(); //clonedCube is an independent copy of originalCube
    ```
*   **Dependencies:** Depends on `Edge.clone()` and `Corner.clone()`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** Relies on `Edge` and `Corner` classes implementing `clone()` correctly (deep copy).

**6. `Cube.toString()`**

*   **Purpose:**  Provides a string representation of the `Cube` object.
*   **Parameters:** None
*   **Return Value:** A string that describes the state of the cube, including its edge and corner configurations.
*   **Functionality:** It concatenates the string "Cube{\n", the result of calling `toString()` on the `edge` object (prefixed with "edge="), the string ",\ncorner=", the result of calling `toString()` on the `corner` object, and the string "\n}".
*   **Business Logic:** This method is primarily for debugging and logging. It provides a human-readable way to inspect the state of a `Cube` object.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Cube myCube = new Cube(...);
    String cubeDescription = myCube.toString(); //cubeDescription will contain something like "Cube{\nedge=...\ncorner=...\n}"
    System.out.println(cubeDescription);
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** Depends on `Edge.toString()` and `Corner.toString()`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (very low)
*   **Pain Points:** The output format is fixed. It might be beneficial to have more control over the string representation.

**7. `Cube.reverseAlgorithm(String s)`**

*   **Purpose:** Reverses a cube solving algorithm represented as a string. Each character is repeated thrice and reversed for some reason.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `s`: A string representing the algorithm to reverse.
*   **Return Value:** A string representing the reversed algorithm.
*   **Functionality:** Iterates through the input string `s`, appending each character three times to a `StringBuilder`. Finally, it reverses the `StringBuilder` and returns the reversed string.
*   **Business Logic:** This seems to be reversing and repeating an encoding of moves; this encoding is not standard for representing Rubik's cube moves.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    String algorithm = "LFRB";
    String reversedAlgorithm = myCube.reverseAlgorithm(algorithm); // reversedAlgorithm will be "BBBRRRFFFLLL"
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** None.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (low). The loop has a simple structure.
*   **Pain Points:** The repetition of each character three times is very unusual and may indicate misunderstanding of move representation. The purpose of this method isn't immediately obvious. The reversal process seems odd and not what one would expect.

**8. `Cube.getAlgorithm(String moves)`**

*   **Purpose:** Simplifies a sequence of Rubik's Cube moves represented as a string. It converts a sequence of moves into a standard notation (e.g., "R R R" becomes "R'").
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `moves`: A string representing a sequence of Rubik's Cube moves (e.g., "RRRR'").
*   **Return Value:** An `ArrayList<String>` representing the simplified algorithm, with each element corresponding to a single move.
*   **Functionality:** This is the most complex function. It uses a stack `s` to keep track of consecutive moves of the same type.
    1.  **Inner Class `Temp`:** A simple helper class to store a character (move type) and a byte (number of repetitions).
    2.  **Initialization:** Creates a stack `s`, an `ArrayList` `v` containing suffixes ("","","2","'"), and an `ArrayList` `result` to store the simplified algorithm.
    3.  **Iteration:** Iterates through the input `moves` string. If the stack is empty or the current character is different from the top of the stack, it pushes a new `Temp` object onto the stack with a count of 1. If the current character is the same as the top of the stack, it increments the count of the top element (up to a maximum of 3).
    4.  **Post-processing:** After the loop, it pops elements from the stack and adds them to the `result` list, adding the appropriate suffix (from `v`) based on the count.
    5.  **Returns:** Returns the `result` list.
*   **Business Logic:** This method takes a raw sequence of moves and converts it into a more compact and readable form. This is useful for displaying algorithms to users or for processing algorithms internally.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    String moves = "RRRLLUUU";
    ArrayList<String> simplifiedAlgorithm = myCube.getAlgorithm(moves);
    // simplifiedAlgorithm will contain ["R'", "L'", "U'"]
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** `Stack`, `ArrayList`, `Arrays`.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Moderate. The nested if-else structure within the loop increases complexity.
*   **Pain Points:** Could be simplified using a more functional approach.  The nested `if/else` statements inside the loop increase the cognitive load. The choice of `byte` for the repetition count is limiting (only up to 3 repetitions are handled).

**9. `Cube.execute(Cube c, String s)`**

*   **Purpose:** Executes a given sequence of moves on a cube.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `c`: The `Cube` object to execute the moves on.
    *   `s`: A string representing the sequence of moves to execute.
*   **Return Value:** A new `Cube` object representing the state of the cube after executing the moves.
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **Cloning:** Creates a deep copy of the input `Cube` object `c` to avoid modifying the original cube.
    2.  **Move Parsing:** Splits the input move string `s` into individual moves based on spaces. If there are spaces present, the code attempts to handle move notations like "R2" (R twice) and "R'" (R inverted). If no spaces are present, the original String is used, character by character.
    3.  **Move Execution Loop:** Iterates through each character (move) in the (potentially processed) string `s`.
        *   **Edge Updates:** Gets the current edge position and orientation. Iterates through the 12 edges, updating both the position and orientation of each edge based on pre-defined `nextEdgePos` and `nextEdgeOrientation` maps (assumed to be class members and not shown here). It uses `nextEdgeOrientation.get(ch).get(edgePos.getVal()[j]).get(edgeOrientation.getVal()[j])` to determine the new orientation of the j-th edge after applying move 'ch', similarly for edge position.
        *   **Corner Updates:** Gets the current corner position and orientation.  Iterates through the 8 corners, updating both the position and orientation of each corner based on pre-defined `nextCornerPos` and `nextCornerOrientation` maps.
        *   **Updates cube state:** Creates new `Edge` and `Corner` objects, using the transformed edge and corner positions and orientations, using it to update the cube.
    4.  **Returns:** Returns the modified `Cube` object.
*   **Business Logic:** This is the core method for applying moves to the cube. It uses pre-computed tables (`nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, `nextCornerOrientation`) to efficiently determine the new state of the cube after each move.
*   **Example:**

    ```java
    Cube myCube = new Cube(...);
    String moves = "R U R' U'";
    Cube newCubeState = myCube.execute(myCube, moves);
    ```

*   **Dependencies:** `Cube.clone()`, `Cube.getEdge()`, `Cube.getCorner()`, `Cube.setEdge()`, `Cube.setCorner()`, `Edge.getEdgePos()`, `Edge.getEdgeOrientation()`, `Corner.getCornerPos()`, `Corner.getCornerOrientation()`, `EdgePos.clone()`, `EdgeOrientation.clone()`, `CornerPos.clone()`, `CornerOrientation.clone()`, `EdgePos.setVal()`, `EdgeOrientation.setVal()`, `CornerPos.setVal()`, `CornerOrientation.setVal()`, `Edge`, `Corner`. Also depends on `nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, `nextCornerOrientation` being properly initialized and accessible.
*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** High.  The multiple nested loops and conditional statements significantly increase the complexity.
*   **Pain Points:** The code is difficult to read and understand due to the many nested loops and table lookups.  The reliance on external maps (`nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, `nextCornerOrientation`) makes it difficult to reason about the correctness of the algorithm without understanding how these maps are generated.  The repeated cloning of `EdgePos`, `EdgeOrientation`, `CornerPos`, and `CornerOrientation` within the loop could be a performance bottleneck. The splitting logic for the `moves` string and its subsequent processing could be simplified. Error handling (e.g., invalid moves) is missing. The fact that the `next...` maps are not class members nor parameters makes the code difficult to analyze in isolation and severely limits reusability/testability. There's a lot of repeated code for edge and corner manipulation. This code exhibits a clear violation of the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).
