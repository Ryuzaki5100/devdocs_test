## Cube Class Documentation

This documentation details the functionality of the `Cube` class, explaining each method and its purpose. The methods are presented in a logical order based on their relationships and typical usage within a Rubik's Cube solving context.

**Fields:**

*   `edge`: An `Edge` object representing the edge pieces of the cube.
*   `corner`: A `Corner` object representing the corner pieces of the cube.
*   `nextEdgePos`:  A `Map` holding information about how edge positions change after each move (U, D, L, R, F, B).
*   `nextEdgeOrientation`: A `Map` holding information about how edge orientations change after each move (U, D, L, R, F, B).
*   `nextCornerPos`: A `Map` holding information about how corner positions change after each move (U, D, L, R, F, B).
*   `nextCornerOrientation`: A `Map` holding information about how corner orientations change after each move (U, D, L, R, F, B).

**1. `Cube.getEdge()`**

```java
public Edge getEdge() {
    return edge;
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method is a getter for the `edge` field of the `Cube` object. It returns the `Edge` object associated with the cube, providing access to the edge piece positions and orientations.

*   **Business Logic:** In the context of a Rubik's Cube, the `Edge` object encapsulates the state of the 12 edge pieces. This method allows access to this state for inspection or manipulation.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (Simple getter method).

*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple and straightforward getter.

**2. `Cube.setEdge(Edge edge)`**

```java
public void setEdge(Edge edge) {
    this.edge = edge;
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method is a setter for the `edge` field of the `Cube` object. It sets the `edge` field to the provided `Edge` object, allowing the cube's edge piece configuration to be updated.

*   **Business Logic:** This is a fundamental method for modifying the state of the cube.  When a move is performed, the `Edge` positions and orientations change.  This method facilitates updating the `Cube`'s internal state to reflect those changes.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (Simple setter method).

*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple and straightforward setter.

**3. `Cube.getCorner()`**

```java
public Corner getCorner() {
    return corner;
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method is a getter for the `corner` field of the `Cube` object. It returns the `Corner` object associated with the cube, providing access to the corner piece positions and orientations.

*   **Business Logic:** Analogous to `getEdge()`, this method provides access to the state of the 8 corner pieces of the cube.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (Simple getter method).

*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple and straightforward getter.

**4. `Cube.setCorner(Corner corner)`**

```java
public void setCorner(Corner corner) {
    this.corner = corner;
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method is a setter for the `corner` field of the `Cube` object. It sets the `corner` field to the provided `Corner` object, allowing the cube's corner piece configuration to be updated.

*   **Business Logic:**  Similar to `setEdge()`, this method allows modification of the `Cube`'s state by setting the corner configurations. It is used to update the cube after a move is performed.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1 (Simple setter method).

*   **Pain Points:** None. This is a simple and straightforward setter.

**5. `Cube.clone()`**

```java
public Cube clone() {
    return new Cube(this.getEdge().clone(), this.getCorner().clone());
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method creates and returns a deep copy of the `Cube` object. It ensures that modifications to the cloned cube do not affect the original cube, and vice-versa.

*   **Business Logic:** This is crucial for algorithms that need to explore different move sequences without altering the original cube's state. It's used to create temporary cubes for simulations or search algorithms.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1.

*   **Pain Points:** Relies on correct `clone()` implementations in the `Edge` and `Corner` classes.  If those clones are shallow, this clone will also be shallow, leading to unexpected behavior.

**6. `Cube.toString()`**

```java
public String toString() {
    return "Cube{\n" + "edge=" + edge.toString() + ",\ncorner=" + corner.toString() + "\n}";
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method provides a string representation of the `Cube` object, making it easy to inspect the cube's state.

*   **Business Logic:** Useful for debugging and logging.  It allows developers to easily see the current configuration of the cube in a human-readable format.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1.

*   **Pain Points:** Depends on the `toString()` methods of the `Edge` and `Corner` classes being informative and well-formatted.

**7. `Cube.reverseAlgorithm(String s)`**

```java
public String reverseAlgorithm(String s) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) result.append(String.valueOf(s.charAt(i)).repeat(3));
    return new StringBuilder(result.toString()).reverse().toString();
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method takes a string representation of a Rubik's Cube algorithm (sequence of moves) and returns its reverse. This reversed algorithm effectively undoes the original algorithm. It triples each move, reverses the resulting string.

*   **Business Logic:** Reversing algorithms is a fundamental technique in Rubik's Cube solving. It's used in many algorithms to undo a sequence of moves and return the cube to a previous state. The tripling of moves makes the inverse easier to compute.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 1

*   **Pain Points:** The tripling and reversing process is not a standard inverse. A standard inverse would have ' as the inverse for no addition, 2 as the inverse for 2, and no addition as the inverse for '. This implementation simplifies the inversion process, but doesn't generate a standard inverse.

**Example:**

If `s` is "RUL", the function will return "LLLUUURRR".

**8. `Cube.getAlgorithm(String moves)`**

```java
public ArrayList<String> getAlgorithm(String moves) {
    class Temp {

        final char ch;

        final byte b;

        public Temp(char ch, byte b) {
            this.ch = ch;
            this.b = b;
        }
    }
    Stack<Temp> s = new Stack<>();
    ArrayList<String> v = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("", "", "2", "'"));
    ArrayList<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++) {
        if (s.isEmpty() || s.peek().ch != moves.charAt(i))
            s.push(new Temp(moves.charAt(i), (byte) 1));
        else {
            Temp x = s.pop();
            if (x.b != (byte) 3)
                s.push(new Temp(x.ch, (byte) (x.b + 1)));
        }
    }
    while (!s.isEmpty()) {
        Temp x = s.pop();
        if (x.b != 0)
            result.add(0, x.ch + v.get(x.b));
    }
    return result;
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This method takes a string of moves (e.g., "RRRUUULLL") and converts it into a more standard algorithm representation (e.g., ["R2", "U2", "L2"]). It groups consecutive identical moves and represents them with multipliers ("2" for two moves, "'" for three moves, effectively a reverse).

*   **Business Logic:**  Rubik's Cube algorithms are often written in a compact format.  This method helps to convert sequences of raw moves into this standard format, making them easier to read and understand.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Moderate.  The loops and conditional statements increase the complexity.

*   **Pain Points:** The use of a local `Temp` class and a `Stack` adds some complexity to the code. Could potentially be simplified using a more straightforward iteration approach. Error handling is missing (e.g., what if `moves` contains invalid characters?).

**Example:**

If `moves` is "RRRUUULLL", the function will return `["R'", "U2", "L'"]`.

**9. `Cube.execute(Cube c, String s)`**

```java
public Cube execute(Cube c, String s) {
    Cube temp = c.clone();
    String[] moves = s.split(" ");
    if (moves.length > 1) {
        StringBuilder sBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (String string : moves) {
            if (string.length() == 1)
                sBuilder.append(string.charAt(0));
            else if (string.charAt(1) == '2')
                sBuilder.append(String.valueOf(string.charAt(0)).repeat(2));
            else
                sBuilder.append(String.valueOf(string.charAt(0)).repeat(3));
        }
        s = sBuilder.toString();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        EdgePos edgePos = temp.getEdge().getEdgePos().clone();
        EdgeOrientation edgeOrientation = temp.getEdge().getEdgeOrientation().clone();
        for (int j = 0; j < 12; j++) {
            edgeOrientation.setVal(j, nextEdgeOrientation.get(ch).get(edgePos.getVal()[j]).get(edgeOrientation.getVal()[j]));
            edgePos.setVal(j, nextEdgePos.get(ch).getVal()[edgePos.getVal()[j]]);
        }
        temp.setEdge(new Edge(edgePos, edgeOrientation));
        CornerPos cornerPos = temp.getCorner().getCornerPos().clone();
        CornerOrientation cornerOrientation = temp.getCorner().getCornerOrientation().clone();
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            cornerOrientation.setVal(j, nextCornerOrientation.get(ch).get(cornerPos.getVal()[j]).get(cornerOrientation.getVal()[j]));
            cornerPos.setVal(j, nextCornerPos.get(ch).getVal()[cornerPos.getVal()[j]]);
        }
        temp.setCorner(new Corner(cornerPos, cornerOrientation));
    }
    return temp;
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This is the core method that simulates the execution of a Rubik's Cube algorithm. It takes a `Cube` object and a string representing the algorithm (sequence of moves) and returns a new `Cube` object representing the state of the cube after the algorithm has been applied.

*   **Business Logic:** This method encapsulates the logic of how each move affects the positions and orientations of the edge and corner pieces.  It uses pre-defined mappings (`nextEdgePos`, `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextCornerPos`, `nextCornerOrientation`) to determine the new state of each piece after each move.

*   **Cyclomatic Complexity:** High. The nested loops and conditional statements significantly increase complexity.

*   **Pain Points:**
    *   **Clarity:** The numerous calls to `getVal()`, `setVal()`, and `clone()` make the code difficult to read and understand. The logic for applying the move is somewhat obscured by the details of accessing and modifying the internal state.
    *   **Performance:** The repeated cloning of `EdgePos`, `EdgeOrientation`, `CornerPos`, and `CornerOrientation` within the loop could be a performance bottleneck, especially for long algorithms.
    *   **Data structures:** Assumes appropriate data structures such as `Map` and `ArrayList` are correctly defined to handle the moves. Improper handling of these external objects may cause issues in the functionality of the function.
    *   **Coupling:**  Highly coupled with the `Edge`, `Corner`, `EdgePos`, `EdgeOrientation`, `CornerPos`, and `CornerOrientation` classes. Changes to those classes could break this method.
    *   **Move Representation:**  The initial parsing of the `s` string is somewhat convoluted. The handling of moves like "R2" and "R'" could be made more explicit and readable.
*   **Error Handling**: No checks are available for invalid moves that are passed and handled by the function.

**Example:**

```java
Cube solvedCube = new Cube(); // Assuming you have a way to initialize a solved cube
Cube scrambledCube = Cube.execute(solvedCube, "R U R' U'"); // Executes the algorithm "R U R' U'"
```
